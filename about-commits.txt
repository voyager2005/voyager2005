Hello!!

So wanted to say that I make a lot of UNWANTED commits... I'm still working my way through github...

How I was able to make soo many unwanted commits:
  • I was unaware that you could preview the changes so it was more like change, commit, check, repeat... 
  • renamed all the files because I did not know that you should keep an extension to the files.
  • learning how to add and remove images
  
Now I am trying to reduce the number of unwanted commits and making it more structured.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are a few naming terms that I now use in my commits they are:
• layout: I use this term when I am changing the layout of my README.md file and not adding anyting new to the readme  
• bug fixes: I use this term when I fix any issues in either in my programs/files or in my readme like the links
• update: I use this when I delete and add some imformatin in my files/README.md
• add: I use this term when I add a new file

Also I created a time table. So I might only contribute on every Monday and Wednesday
